The local variables `a` and `b` are initialized on lines 1-2, and set to the values `4` and `2` respectively. Then the `loop` method is invoked and passed a block. The local variable `c` is initialized within the inner scope of the block and assigned to the value `3`. Then `a` is reassigned to the value referenced by `c`, in this case `3`. Both variables point to the same object.

Upon returning to the outer scope, the `puts` method is invoked twice on lines 10-11 and passed the values referenced by the variables `a` and `b` respectively. `a`, which was reassigned to the value `3` in the inner scope of the block, still has that value and so that value gets printed. `b` retains its original value `2` and that gets printed as well (`3`, `2`). Both invocations of `puts` return `nil`.

This demonstrates variable scope within the context of a block. Variables initialized outside the block's scope are accessible within it, and when changed there retain their new values when returning to the outer scope.



This will first output `4`, but then result in an error about `b` being an undefined variable/method.

The local variable `a` is initialized on line 1 and set to the value `4`. Then the `loop` method is invoked and passed a block from lines 3-7. Within the inner scope of the block, the variable `a` is reassigned to the value `5`, and the variable `b` is initialized and set to the value `3`. After returning to the outer scope, the `puts` method is called twice and passed the values referenced by `a` and `b` as arguments. `a` was initialized in the outer scope and its new value `5` can be printed, but `b` was not initialized in the outer scope and so it is undefined here.

This demonstrates how local variable scope works with respect to the inner scope of a block. Local variables initialized within the inner scope cannot be accessed after leaving that scope domain.

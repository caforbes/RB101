# Method definition and invocation


## Methods


Method definitions are special operations using the keyword `def` to create a saved set of commands, associated with a method name. At the point of method definition, a method can be associated with parameters, special method-internal variables that are associated with argument values later.

Method invocation is calling on a set of commands by way of the name used to define them. At the time of method invocation, values are passed to the method to serve as arguments, and those argument values are bound to the parameter variable names the method was defined with.

## Blocks


Blocks are defined at the point of method invocation with the use of `do..end` or curly braces `{..}`. Other instances of these do not constitute blocks. Blocks are defined at method invocation because they are anonymous functions whose arguments, return values, and scope are largely handled by the method definition itself.

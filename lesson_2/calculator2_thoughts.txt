Pull the whole looping logic of getting a number into its own method, instead of JUST the validation part. A lot of lines are repeated!

2.
read the docs.

3. 
If we need to add code after the case statement, it will be important to save the output of the case statement to a variable and ensure that that variable is returned implicitly or explicitly.

Kernel documentation says these methods are called "without a receiver" -- seems to imply that there is a very large scale object that they may be methods of, but that it's a special kind of object that does not need to be referred to outright. Objects are instances of Kernel, so is Kernel a class of the environment or somesuch? No, Kernel is a module that contains both class and instance methods... something very large includes these methods and doesn't require reference.
Kernel includes procedures, that is things that would explicitly ignore the receiver, so it's possible to not include the receiver at all.
=> this giant object I was envisioning is real, it's a thing called main which loads the properties of Object.

extract message files into a config file (hashlike?) and lookup values. store multiple languages. COOL!

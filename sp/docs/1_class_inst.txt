File::path
- take a path as an argument (String or Pathname object)
- returns string of the input path (?)

File#path
- takes no argument
- returns string version of the path used to initialize File
- may not be the current path of File


differences:
- one is a class method (::path), one is an instance method (#path)
- therefore only the latter relates to a specific File instance
- the other just helps interpret Pathname objects I suppose?
- differ in the number of input parameters
- differ in the relation of their output to a File instance, but not the format


ps: find this on the File object page

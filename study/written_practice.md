The local variables `a` and `b` are initialized on lines 1-2, and set to the values `4` and `2` respectively. Then the `loop` method is invoked and passed a block. The local variable `c` is initialized within the inner scope of the block and assigned to the value `3`. Then `a` is reassigned to the value referenced by `c`, in this case `3`. Both variables point to the same object.

Upon returning to the outer scope, the `puts` method is invoked twice on lines 10-11 and passed the values referenced by the variables `a` and `b` respectively. `a`, which was reassigned to the value `3` in the inner scope of the block, still has that value and so that value gets printed. `b` retains its original value `2` and that gets printed as well (`3`, `2`). Both invocations of `puts` return `nil`.

This demonstrates variable scope within the context of a block. Variables initialized outside the block's scope are accessible within it, and when changed there retain their new values when returning to the outer scope.



This will first output `4`, but then result in an error about `b` being an undefined variable/method.

The local variable `a` is initialized on line 1 and set to the value `4`. Then the `loop` method is invoked and passed a block from lines 3-7. Within the inner scope of the block, the variable `a` is reassigned to the value `5`, and the variable `b` is initialized and set to the value `3`. After returning to the outer scope, the `puts` method is called twice and passed the values referenced by `a` and `b` as arguments. `a` was initialized in the outer scope and its new value `5` can be printed, but `b` was not initialized in the outer scope and so it is undefined here.

This demonstrates how local variable scope works with respect to the inner scope of a block. Local variables initialized within the inner scope cannot be accessed after leaving that scope domain.



This code will output `5` two times, and then `4` and `2` for the final values of `a` and `b` respectively. This is an instances of variable shadowing, which demonstrates the behavior of local variable scope as it interacts with parameter setting within a block.

I'll discuss only the the local variable `a` here. It is initialized on line 1 and set to the value `4`. On line 4 the `times` method is invoked; it takes the integer `2` as an argument and is also passed a block defined from lines 4-7 with `do..end`. The block is defined with one parameter `a`, which has the same name as the local variable `a` in the outer scope. In the context of the block, the local variable `a` from the outer scope and its value are temporarily blocked, and only the block parameter `a` is accessible. It is initially passed the value `0` from the `times` method, and then is further reassigned to the value `5` on line 5. On line 6 the `puts` method is invoked and passed the value referenced by the parameter `a`: `5`. This repeats a second time, resulting in two outputs of the value `5`. (`puts` returns `nil` each time, and `times` returns its argument `2`.)

Then finally, after returning to the outer scope, `puts` is called now on the local variable `a`. This variable was unaffected by the changes made to the reference of the block parameter `a`. Outside the scope of the block, those changes are now irrelevant and variable `a` points to its original unchanged value `4`; this is output by `puts` on line 9.

a method that returns the sum of two integers

get two integers and save each of them
verify they are integers??
add the two values together
print/return the sum

START

	SET val_1 = first integer
	SET val_2 = second integer

	IF val_1 not an integer, reset it to integer
	IF val_2 not an integer, reset it to integer

	SET result = val_1 + val_2
	PRINT result

END



a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

given an array of strings
take the first string and save it somewhere
move to the second string and concatenate it to that value
for each iteration, continue concatenating
return the saved value

START
	
	SET list = array of strings

	SET result = blank string

	WHILE iterator < length of list
		SET result = prior result + current iteration element
		move to next iteration
		iterator + 1

	PRINT result

END



a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

given an array of integers
create a new array
look at the first element of the list and add it to the array
move two iterations forward in the list
if that is not past the end of the list (there is an element), add it to the list
return the new array

START
	
	SET original = array of integers
	SET result = empty array

	SET counter = 0
	WHILE counter < length of original
		get element at index counter of original array
		add it to result
		counter = counter + 2

	PRINT result

END
